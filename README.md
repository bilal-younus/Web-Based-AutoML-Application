# New way for building ML pipelines!

We are working on new way for Python visual programming.  We developed desktop application called [MLJAR Studio](https://mljar.com). 
It is a notebook based development environment with interactive code recipes and managed Python environment. All running locally on your machine. We are waiting for your feedback.

It has [code recipes](https://mljar.com/docs/python-automl/) to build ML pipelines with MLJAR AutoML.

This is a Web Application designed to train Machine Learning pipelines using MLJAR AutoML, specifically tailored for tabular data. All the generated models are compressed into an archive format, allowing their reuse to compute predictions in batch mode.

This repo consists of three notebooks:
- [notebook](https://github.com/mljar/automl-app/blob/main/train-automl.ipynb) for training AutoML with simple UI,
- [advanced notebook](https://github.com/mljar/automl-app/blob/main/train-automl-advanced.ipynb) for training AutoML with more advanced UI (you can select feature engineering methods, algorithms, validation strategy, and evaluation metric),
- [notebook](https://github.com/mljar/automl-app/blob/main/automl-predict.ipynb) for computing predictions.


The Web App harnesses the capabilities of [mljar-supervised](https://github.com/mljar/mercury) to construct the Machine Learning pipeline with AutoML. This involves the automation of several key tasks:
- data preprocessing,
- features engineering,
- algorithm selection & tuning,
- ML models explanations,
- automatic documentation.

The Web App is created directly from Jupyter Notebooks with [Mercury](https://github.com/mljar/mercury) framework.

### Demo

</kbd>

### Run locally 🖥️

Please run the below commands to run Web App locally. It requires Python >= 3.8.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mercury run
```
 
### Training Notebook 📓

If you would like to increase the input file limit, please change the cell:

```python
data_file = mr.File(label="Upload CSV with training data", max_file_size="100MB")
```

and set your `max_file_size`.

Please change the following cell to increase training time:

```python
time_limit = mr.Select(label="Time limit (seconds)", value="60", choices=["60", "120", "240", "300"])
```

Times are in seconds. Please just increase the values.
